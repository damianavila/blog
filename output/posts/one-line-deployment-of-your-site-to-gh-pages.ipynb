      "\n",
      "2. Almost for sure, your site/blog lives in the master branch of the new repository, but you need to generated a `gh-pages` branch to push your `build` or `output` folder, I mean your site/blog content to deploy... not all the machinery of your site/blog platform (**Nikola** in my case):\n",
