I have implemented reveal.js slides for vIPer (I will publish a 
post about that the next days...).

**Note** from the future: example no longer available

Then, I showed the resulting slides http://www.slideviper.oquanta.info/reveal/Example_new_slides.html
to some IPython team members and one of them, Brian, says:

    "it would be great if nbcovert could output reveal.js slides."

and then, Fernando (if you know what is IPython, you know these guys) replies:

    "we can certainly add that kind of functionality as output options..."

So, keeping in mind the implementation in vIPer, I provided a dirty and basic
new implementation to get reveal-based slides from nbconvert.

.. TEASER_END

To test it just go to:

    https://github.com/damianavila/nbconvert.git

switch to branch slider_converter, 

and type:

    python nbconvert.py -f slider example_slide.ipynb

You can see a video showing the basic functionality here
(big sorry for the quality, I will post a better one soon):

There is a lot of stuff to do with that... I will do it when I get some free time.

Just my two cents!

Enjoy!
