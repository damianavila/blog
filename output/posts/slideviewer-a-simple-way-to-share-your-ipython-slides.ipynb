      "**After some months of silence, I am back... A lot of things have happened in my life lately, some of them are really good things... some others don't. And all those things kept me very busy, but finally I have made me some time to write again! ;-)**\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, I have a long list of news, topics, ideas and developments I want to share with you, but we have to begin with one of them, and the chosen one is `Slideviewer`.\n",

      "\n",
      "When I was at **SciPy 2013**, one of the talks I presented was about the **IPython slides** (if you dont know what I am talking about, just check some of these [posts](http://www.damian.oquanta.info/categories/slideshow.html)). And one of the last things I presented in that talk was an early prototype of **Slideviewer**, an [**NBviewer**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)'s clon, but able to render **IPython slides** instead of plain **IPython notebooks** (`.ipynb`).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main idea behind **Slideviewer** was to provide you an easy way to share your **IPython slides**. As I pointed out in older posts and comments, you can *deploy* your **IPython slides** (the slides.html file plus the **reveal.js** library) using **Github pages** or any other service, but with **Slideviewer**, you only need to host your `.ipynb` somewhere (ie, **Github** repo, gist, etc.), and just pass the url to the **Slideviewer** service (the same way you do it with the NBviewer service) which will render your `.ipynb` to an IPython slide *automagically*.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Slideviewer** will follow **NBviewer** updates once a week, as close as it can be, essentially because some things are relevant for both apps, but others don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, in the future, we can probably merge the **Slideviewer** app onto the **NBviewer** app, but we need to make some things first, so I think is useful to have a separate service running right now, to help people to easily spread their **IPython slides**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Slideviewer** lives here (for now): [http://slideviewer.herokuapp.com/](http://slideviewer.herokuapp.com/) and you can see it *iframed* below:"

      "**Note**: **Slideviewer** does not support `custom.css` from **Github** (because **Github** does not *serve* the css), but you can always use another place to host your `.ipynb` and `custom.css` or change the html source code pointing to another url where the css was deployed and served. If you need help with this issue, let me know. I will try to figure out a native solution soon. \n",
