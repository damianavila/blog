    "* Do we want to have Sphinx-free support for rendering roles and directives in the MyST-Parser \n",

    "    Nikola (among other projects) already have their own machinery (based in Docutils) to\n",
    "    build the final HTML output. Getting the docutils object from the Python API would be\n",
    "    a super interesting way to easily expose and provide that object to the downstream\n",
    "    projects!\n",
    "\n",
    "    One caveat with this approach would be missing some Sphinx features (ie. cross-linking\n",
    "    between documents) based on custom roles and directives that we may need to re-implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do we want to have docutils-free support for roles and directives in the MyST Python API?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Docutils actually introduces the roles and directives concept (that Sphinx extend) so if\n",
    "    we want to go docutils-free, then we will need to re-implement those concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Does it makes sense to create a docutils alternative in Python? How much of its functionality would need to be replicated? How should it be extended or enhanced?\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is currently a nice example about an alternative implementation from the\n",
    "    Executable Books community, but in the Javascript world: https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-docutils ;-).\n",
    "    Since we do not have Docutils there, it actually makes a lot of sense to write something\n",
    "    new. But, what is the value/need/place for an alternative implementation in Python?\n",
    "    Maybe, we do not need the whole Docutils stuff... but we maybe need some core\n",
    "    functionality?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we decide to write some minimal support, what pieces are we interested to bring first?\n",
    "    Where those pieces should end up? The `markdown-it-docutils` package I referenced above is\n",
    "    actually a `markdown-it` (JS) plugin. If we follow that pattern, we should create a new\n",
    "    `markdown-it-py-docutils` plugin and we are no longer in the MyST-Parser territory.\n",
    "    But the MyST-Parser has, in fact, some [parsing directive functions](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/master/myst_parser/parse_directives.py).\n",
    "    We may need to move that toward `markdown-it-py` as the [JS plugin does](https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-docutils/blob/main/src/directives/main.ts).\n",
    "    That sounds nice, but... is there any other suitable (simpler) alternatives besides the\n",
    "    one I proposed above?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally,in the MyST community, there are some ongoing discussions about developing a\n",
    "MyST specification that represent what we understand as the MyST language. Having one\n",
    "specification could be interesting and super useful because different actors interested\n",
    "in writing a MyST parser for their own space can check their stuff against that\n",
