Nikola is a static site generator created by a member of the
`PyAr <http://python.org.ar/pyar>`__ community (Roberto Alsina).
It is a great project and the pythonic-way I choose to blog again... 

I hope to contribute to the project in the near future 
(I promise to Roberto to send some improvements but I have not pull-requested to github yet... 
I will do it soon). 

The web-page of the project is http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar , powered by itself, of course!

Enjoy it!

Dami√°n.

PS: The theme you are seeing right now it is not included in the Nikola themes folder, 
I will post it soon...
