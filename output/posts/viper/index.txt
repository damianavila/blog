vIPer is an application specifically designed to work with 
`IPython <http://ipython.org/>`__ notebooks.

It is a Python project I have been developing for the last weeks...

Here, you can see a video of one of my beloved features, a direct slide-show mode
for working notebooks:

vIPer was proposed for a talk for SciPy 2012, and it was accepted! But, I had to cancel the talk
because I did not win the SciPy sponsorship and Texas is far from here (Argentina), 
not only in miles, but also in money. So, most probably, I will show it in the next PyConAr. 

Obviously, vIPer will be available soon...

See you!
