    "We had a 2 days **Aikido** and **Iaido** [seminar](http://cordobaaikikai.com.ar/#!/-seminario-corbal-2018/) taught by [Shihan Ricardo Corbal](http://asaikido.com.ar/ricardo-corbal-sensei/).\n",

    "Yesterday, after two really nice and crowded classes, we had some kyu and dan tests.\n",
    "And I tested for the **Shodan** degree (1st black belt in **Aikido**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the conclusion of a long journey... or, actually the beginning!\n",
    "\n",
    "I started to practice **Aikido** in 1999 under **Sensei Oscar Medina**.\n",
    "And I practiced there for about 5 years.\n",
    "But for several reasons, included the tragic death of my **Sensei** and friend in a traffic accident, I discontinued my practice.\n",
    "Then, a lot of happened in my life, and after several years, in 2016 (yes, about 11 years later) I restarted to practice again in [**Córdoba Aikikai**](http://cordobaaikikai.com.ar/#!/-home/) (previously known as Kogarashi dojo) under the teaching of **Sensei José Delgado** and **Sensei Eugenio Fernández**, and more recently also under the teaching of **Sensei Nico Coll**.\n",
    "I practiced the whole 2016, but 2017 surprised me with a lot of international and national travels, so I re-restarted again in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after about 7-8 years of discontinued practice, I finally was ready to test for the **Shodan** degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to thank a lot of people who helped me in this phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensei Oscar Medina**, who introduced me to the art of **Aikido** and became one of my most beloved friends (I miss you!)\n",
    "* **Sensei José** and **Sensei Eugenio**, who opened me the doors of Kogarashi and re-introduce me in the **Aikido** practice. Those two guys are wonderful human beings and friends\n",
    "* **Sensei Nico**, who recently joined José and Eugenio to start a new journey called **Córdoba Aikikai** (Sensei, thanks for being my uke in the test!)\n",
    "* All the **Córdoba Aikikai community**, a lot of people who are transiting their own paths in **Aikido** helping each other on a daily basis\n",
    "* **Shihan Ricardo Corbal**, who kindly provided us with this teachings and took my test (thanks for the post-test tips, I will work hard on those points to make them better) \n",
    "* **Daniela**, my love, who is really supportive and helped me in all this process\n",

    "OK, this is video, in case you want to see some action ;-)\n",
