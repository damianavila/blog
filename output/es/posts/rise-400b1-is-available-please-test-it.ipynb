    "In case you don't know about it, with **RISE** you get your **Jupyter** notebook rendered as a Reveal.js-based slideshow, where you can **execute** code on the fly or show to the audience whatever you can show/do inside the notebook itself (but in a \"slidy\" way).\n",

    "You have several ways to get it that I described here: https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#installation\n",

    "The 4.0.0 release essentially deals with packaging and stuff to be compatible with the latest mechanisms on the **Jupyter** notebook to install and enable *nbextensions* (and **RISE** is a *nbextension*). But also fixes bugs and provide some enhancements.\n",

    "Please report any issues with the beta here: https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/issues\n",

    "Have fun!!\n",

    "PS: I will write a more detailed post about **RISE** later. There are a lot of things to share about it!"
