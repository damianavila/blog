      "Up to now, I have replaced the old converters by the new ones: the `HTMLExporter` and the `SlidesExporter` from `IPython.nbconvert`. As a consequence, vIPer now supports the generation of **IPython slides** (deprecating the use of Landslide to get the html-powered slideshow... thank you very much to the Landslide developers for their work... and to make my life easier at the first days of vIPer).\n",
