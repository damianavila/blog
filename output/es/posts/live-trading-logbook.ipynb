      "After some weeks of silence, he he... I come back with a short post about *live* trading in the **forex** market.\n",
      "As you probably know [if not, you are knowing it right now ;-)], one of my interests is the *analysis*, *modeling* and* forecasting* of financial time series. To make it short, I have developed some statistical models to forecast the dynamic of selected portfolios.\n",
      "Currently, I am trading equities and other more complex financial derivatives. But my models are also suitable to apply to other markets, ie. the **foreign exchange** market (yes... **forex**). So, I made a quick research on some interesting **forex** pairs and then I started a little account to perform some *live trades* accordingly to these models.\n",
      "And now, I pretend to *log* the trades from this little account in a subset of post on my blog, a sort of public *live trading logbook*.\n",
