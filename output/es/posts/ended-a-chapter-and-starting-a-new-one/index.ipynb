    "I joined [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) on April 2021 after experiencing successful and enriching chapters in company-like and university-like environments. **2i2c** is a non-for-profit organization with the [mission](https://2i2c.org/mission/) to make research and education more impactful, accessible, and delightful by developing, operating, and supporting infrastructure for interactive computing. I started as an **OSIE** (Open Source Infrastructure Engineer) and eventually became an **Engineering Manager** for the Engineering team.\n",
    "\n",
    "During all these years at **2i2c**, I had the opportunity to build super impactful stuff, side-by-side, with [**AWESOME** people](https://2i2c.org/organization/).\n",
    "And I really appreciate and enjoyed that opportunity.\n",
    "But some months ago, and after a lot of thinking, I realized I needed some real **break**/**resting** time to re-align myself, think about the future, and potentially **explore** new worlds.\n",
    "And without a clear cut that would have been impossible, so I decided to leave **2i2c** by the end of August.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was emotionally demanding not only because of all the **great connections** I have with the **2i2c** team members, some of them even older than the organization itself, but also because I believe in the impactfulness of (and I care about) **2i2c**'s mission.\n",
    "But after the initial impact, a nice holiday on the beach, a lot of time with **my family** and a lot of time with **myself** (and out of the daily \"voragine\"), I am now feeling invigorated and excited about the idea of new challenges lying ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually the first time in years I do not have something lined up before departing from the organization I was part of.\n",
    "That was a **conscientious decision** so I could explore different ideas, concepts, and potential new paths before choosing what the new chapter was gonna be about.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am still **exploring** the broad space (although I do think that exploration phase is sunsetting), so if you have some interesting ideas/problems/challenges (there is a lot of new and exciting stuff being built out there!) and you believe my [knowledge and expertise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-avila/) can help you to push forward those ones, you can reach me at `damianavila AT gmail DOT com` (or you can also drop me a DM on [X](https://x.com/damian_avila) or [Telegram](https://t.me/damian_avila) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-avila/)). \n",
