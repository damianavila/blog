For almost five years, I have been traveling from 
La Plata to C.A.B.A. (and vice-versa) by car, by bus, by subway, by train... almost every day. 
A lot of hours of public transportation have run "under the bridge". 
As you can imagine, I have read a lot of papers, books and newspapers. 
I have listened hundreds of songs. I have talked with several friends. 
Also, I have slept a lot... But, I did not write... 
(OK, I wrote some things but in lower levels than the other activities). 
So, from now, until I finish my work in C.A.B.A., 
I will invest my everyday journeys to write "something" and paste it in this blog.

See you soon!
