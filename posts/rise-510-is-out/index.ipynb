    "* `smart exec` allows you to execute cells and then proceed to the next cell *WHEN* the context permits, pretty similar to the native experience in the notebook view but it takes into consideration the slideshow view limitations and particularities\n",
    "* `auto_select` allows you to automatically select the first (or first code) cell any time you either move to a new slide, subslide or when you show (or hide) a new fragment\n",
    "* new `overlay`, `header`, `background` and `footer` customizable options\n",
    "* customizable CSS\n",
    "* keyboard customization through the notebook keyboard manager\n",
