    "Coming back to the nice practice of release my own **IPython** *nbextensions*, today I will release two extensions I use a lot in my daily workflow: `loader` and `writer`, useful extensions to load files into the **IPython notebook** and to write the content to the same (or another) file.\n",
    "<!-- TEASER_END -->\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: These extensions were developed some months ago, and probably you can write better versions of them using the new IPython widget infrastructure, but these were nice `hacks` and they are still useful in th IPython 1.x and 2.x series, so I think they deserve to go public.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the **IPython notebook** a lot, you know that if you are frequently reading my blog. Not only to write blog posts, but also to write other kind of stuff, for instance: code. Some time ago, I used to write code in a plain text editor next to an IPython console, sometimes I used [**NINJA-IDE**](http://ninja-ide.org/) because it is a nice and featured platform. But right now, I am developing inside the **IPython notebook** because it gives me the text editor and the console in one place, with a lot of other useful features. But I will postpone the description of my workflow for some post to come in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "I just want to tell you how I easily fixed a missing feature (for now, because it will be present in the future, for sure) in the **IPython notebook** using *nbextensions*. The problem was simple, you can use the `%load` and `%write_file` magics to load and write files. But I want some minimal user inteface to:\n",

    "2. write a cell content to a file with just a click.\n",
