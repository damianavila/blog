      "Just a quick update... Some weeks ago I [blogged](http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/a-new-nikolas-theme-for-my-site-zen.html) about my new **Nikola**'s theme family called **Zen**. In fact, you are seeing the `zen-ipython` theme powering my blog right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used them for several days without any remarkable issue, so I decided to release them at the **Nikola**'s [theme repository](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-themes).\n",
      "\n",
      "There, you will see three **Zen** themes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `zen`, based in *mako* templates\n",
      "* `zen-jinja`, the same *zen* theme but based (obviously) in *jinja* templates\n",
      "* `zen-ipython`, a *jinja*-based *zen* theme suited to be used with the IPython notebooks.\n",
      "<!-- TEASER_END -->\n",
      "\n",
      "As you know, you can easily install them using the following command inside your **Nikola** site folder:\n",
      "\n",
      "`nikola install_theme zen` \n",
      "\n",
      "(or `zen-jinja`... or `zen-ipython`, or whatever theme available at http://themes.getnikola.com/). \n",
      "\n",
      "I have developed the **Zen** theme family with a *high customization* concept in my mind... but this approach has a cost because you need to use a *proper* `conf.py` file to run them ok (the default one will not work, but you can find a working example looking at my blog `conf.py` [file](https://github.com/damianavila/damian_blog/blob/master/conf.py)).\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, it's all for this post. \n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy the **Zen** themes and, as usually, report me any problem...\n",
