You can see the description of the request [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18820253/modifying-reveal-js-defaults-in-ipython-notebook-slide-generation).

      "* The IPython machinery is very configurable through a **Traitlets** system! And because of this feature, `IPython.nbconvert` is able to take a custom config file and use it to render our IPython slides (or any other `IPython.nbconvert` *formats*).\n",
