    "I am planning to write about those past things... about the experience I acquired during this time. But I am also interested into discuss new and exciting things, not only in the technical side, but also in other aspects of my interests and feelings.\n",

    "Let's do a quick update:\n",
    "* My son, Facundo, is 3 years old now... and he's my Sun.\n",
    "* I live at Cordoba now... with my fiance, and my Moon, Daniela.\n",
    "* I have a lovely kitty called Bituinas (between us ;-)\n",
    "* I still do Software Development (for a living and for free) and I enjoy it a lot.\n",
    "* I am still involved with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) project. I am a Jupyter core developer and a Jupyter Steering Council member. [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), the live Jupyter slideshow machinery, is widely used but I need to give it more love (and time).\n",
    "* Now, I am a gluten-free guy and because of that, I have lost weight and improved my arterial tension measurements ;-)\n",
    "* Recently, I restarted to practice Aikido.\n",
