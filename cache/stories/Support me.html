<p>I am currently looking for a continuous flow of money so I can spend more of my daily time on the Open Source arena, particularly developing and supporting <strong>RISE</strong> and other Jupyter-related projects, and exploring some new ideas...</p>
<p>Basically, you have 2-3 ways to fund some of my work.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://ko-fi.com/damianavila">https://ko-fi.com/damianavila</a> you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy me some stars as general support (and you will be listed on this page)</li>
<li>Buy a "commission" to support the accomplishment of diverse goals (see each specific commission for more details)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, these commissions are intended to support the accomplishment of diverse goals.
Currently, most of them are associated with <strong>RISE</strong> support and ongoing development.
This is just a <strong>one-time</strong> commission, so if you want to support me in a <strong>continuous/recurrent</strong> way, you can buy a higher commission/tier (not monthly subscription available)!</p>
<p>If you are interested in supporting <strong>RISE</strong> evolution, I <strong>highly</strong> encourage you to choose one of the <strong>RISE</strong>-related available commissions. Press the "Commission Me" button (or visit this page: <a href="https://ko-fi.com/damianavila/commissions">https://ko-fi.com/damianavila/commissions</a>) for more details on each commission. Btw, buying a commission will allow you to be listed on the supporters' page at the <strong>RISE</strong> site (logos reserved for high tiers commissions).</p>
<p>Finally, if you don't like this platform (or the associated electronic payment method) and you still want to support my work or, maybe, you are a company and you need to process things outside of this platform, you can drop me a DM at <code>@damian_avila</code> on <a href="https://twitter.com/damian_avila">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://t.me/damian_avila">Telegram</a> and we can figure it out better alternatives for you. You can also reach me at <strong>damianavila AT gmail DOT com</strong>, if you are from the old guard ;-)</p>
<p>Thank <strong>YOU</strong>!</p>
