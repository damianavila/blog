<p>For almost five years, I have been traveling from
La Plata to C.A.B.A. (and vice-versa) by car, by bus, by subway, by train... almost every day.
A lot of hours of public transportation have run &quot;under the bridge&quot;.
As you can imagine, I have read a lot of papers, books and newspapers.
I have listened hundreds of songs. I have talked with several friends.
Also, I have slept a lot... But, I did not write...
(OK, I wrote some things but in lower levels than the other activities).
So, from now, until I finish my work in C.A.B.A.,
I will invest my everyday journeys to write &quot;something&quot; and paste it in this blog.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
