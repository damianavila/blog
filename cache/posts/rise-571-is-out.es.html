<h3 id="What-are-the-latest-news?"><em>What are the latest news?</em><a class="anchor-link" href="#What-are-the-latest-news?">¶</a></h3><p><strong>Wait!</strong> Latest release was 5.6.1, where is <strong>RISE</strong> 5.7.0?</p>
<p>We shipped 5.7.0 a few days ago and we found some issues that deserved immediate patches and a new shiny release.
This is why you have <strong>RISE</strong> 5.7.1 available now.</p>
<p>So, these releases were mainly focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding color support to the chalkboard</li>
<li>Upload to reveal.js 3.9.2</li>
<li>Fix not working notes keyboard shortcut (5.7.0 bug)</li>
<li>Fix buttons disappearance (5.7.0 bug)</li>
<li>New setting rise.show_buttons_on_startup (#561)</li>
<li>Enforce notebook &gt;= 6.0</li>
<li>Add a new support page in the documentation</li>
<li>New sources layout, in anticipation for a future jlab extension: sources are now split between rise-reveal that contains an npm package that wraps the official reveal.js for our needs, and classic that contains the actual code for the RISE classic extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see a detailed changelog <a href="https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#changes">here</a>.</p>
