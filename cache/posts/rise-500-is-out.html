<p>We're pleased to announce the release of RISE 5.0.0!</p>
<p><strong>RISE</strong> let's you show yout <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebook rendered as an <strong>executable</strong> Reveal.js-based slideshow. It is your very same notebook but in a <em>slidy</em> way!</p>
<p><em>How you can get it?</em></p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>If you live in the <strong>conda/anaconda ecosystem</strong>, you can install it with <code>conda install -c damianavila82 rise</code>.</p>
<p>For further information about other installations, check <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#installation">https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#installation</a>.</p>
<p>This released was focused in updating <strong>Reveal.js</strong> to the latest (3.5.0) and fix several bugs in the config mechanism. We also re-did the scrolling feature and, <em>finally</em>, we built the python 3.6 conda packages.</p>
<p>Please report any issues here: <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/issues">https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/issues</a></p>
<p>And enjoy it!</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: If you are using/developing <strong>RISE</strong> from master (I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend you to use the packaged solutions if you don't want to develop on it), it would a good idea to reinstall the whole thing from scratch to avoid collisions between the previous way to get Reveal.js and the current one. For more information about the <em>development installation</em>, please check <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#development">https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#development</a></p>
