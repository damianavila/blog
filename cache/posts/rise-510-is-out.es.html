<p>We're pleased to announce the release of RISE 5.1.0!</p>
<p><strong>RISE</strong> allows you show your <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebooks rendered as an <em>executable</em> <code>Reveal.js</code>-based slideshow. It is your very same notebook but <em>presented</em> in a <em>slidy</em> way!</p>
<p><em>What are the new goodies for this release?</em>
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<ul>
<li><code>autolaunch</code> config option to enable immediate launch of the slideshow view as soon as you open your notebook, very useful to use at mybinder.</li>
<li><code>smart exec</code> allows you to execute cells and then proceed to the next cell <em>WHEN</em> the context permits, pretty similar to the native experience in the notebook view but it takes into consideration the slideshow view limitations and particularities</li>
<li><code>auto_select</code> allows you to automatically select the first (or first code) cell any time you either move to a new slide, subslide or when you show (or hide) a new fragment</li>
<li>new <code>overlay</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>background</code> and <code>footer</code> customizable options</li>
<li>customizable CSS</li>
<li>keyboard customization through the notebook keyboard manager</li>
<li>new keyboard shortcuts to toggle cells as <code>slide</code>, <code>subslides</code> and <code>fragments</code></li>
</ul>
