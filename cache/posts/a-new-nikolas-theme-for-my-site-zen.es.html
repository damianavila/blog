<p>Some days ago, <a href="https://plus.google.com/106780152352450272697/about">Aru Sahni</a> wrote to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nikola-discuss">Nikola's</a> forum and posted a link to his site... I really like the theme he was using so I though to take it as a starting point to develop my own theme.
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<p>I had to re-wrote some things to accommodate the templates to the last Nikola v6.0.0 release (in fact, I usually use master from Github, but I recommend you to use the released code for production), and to make the theme more generic one and easy to re-use by others.</p>
<p>I got a clean and (I think) <em>easy to read</em> theme, with awesome icons (Font-awesome's if you didn't recognize yet), supporting both desktops/laptops and mobile devices and... I like it very much ;-)</p>
<p>It was a great exercise to learn more about html, js, css and less (a very interesting approach to deal with css).</p>
<p>I will publish the generic <strong>zen</strong> theme and the <strong>zen-ipython</strong> theme (which I'm using and you are seeing... right now) at the <a href="https://github.com/ralsina/nikola-themes">Nikola theme</a> repository in a few days, after some more testing and customization.</p>
<p>Thanks again Aru Sahni, you are in some way the trigger for this theme... and very fun hours I experienced developing and learning by doing.</p>
<p>Damián.</p>
<p>PS: If you have any to say about the overall design, ideas for improvements, things you hate about this theme, just let me know in the comments. Thanks.</p>
