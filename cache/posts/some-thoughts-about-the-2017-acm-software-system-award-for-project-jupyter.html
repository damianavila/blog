<p>I am very happy to inform you that <strong>Project Jupyter</strong> has been awarded the 2017 <strong>ACM Software System Award</strong>!</p>
<p>As part of the <em>Jupyter Steering Council</em>, I am one of the official recipients of the award, but I wanted to highlight that I am just one member of a large group of people (contributors and users) working together to push the <strong>Project Jupyter</strong> forward and beyond its limits.</p>
<p><strong>Project Jupyter</strong> is an essential part of my life. It gave me the opportunity to work with amazing people, to learn a lot of new things, to help other people. Some years ago, I left academia for several reasons, but one of the most important ones was to find an opportunity to make a substantial impact on people’s lives. I wanted to be involved in something that could empower people to do amazing things. And I certainly believe that <strong>Project Jupyter</strong> filled that space and allowed me to achieve that goal more than I could imagine.</p>

<h3 id="Why-is-Project-Jupyter-receiving-the-ACM-Award?">Why is <strong>Project Jupyter</strong> receiving the ACM Award?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-is-Project-Jupyter-receiving-the-ACM-Award?">¶</a></h3><p>There are several reasons, but let’s focus on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jupyter</strong> is explicitly designed for the task of computing interactively</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jupyter</strong> has become an important part of the daily workflow in research, education, journalism, and industry allowing people to process, analyze, and manipulate data and get insights from it in a fluid, pleasant, and effective way.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Jupyter</strong> fosters communication and collaboration through open standardized formats</li>
</ol>
<p>The open and standardized <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebook file format is designed to capture, display and share natural language, code, and results in a single computational narrative. This is a key aspect of the scientific and research life cycle. You want to share your findings and thoughts with other people and <strong>Jupyter</strong> helps with that goal providing a self-contained and powerful computational narrative.</p>
<p>The stability and interoperability of open standards also provide a foundation for others to experiment, collaborate, and build tools inspired by their unique goals and perspectives. We have also provided tools to support <strong>Jupyter</strong> deployment in multi-user environments, making it easier to access common computational resources and share live computational environments. <strong>JupyterHub</strong> (and <strong>Binder</strong>) now supports industry deployment, large-scale education and reproducible research.</p>
<p>But the most important thing here, as I said before, is the <strong>Jupyter Community</strong>. <strong>IPython</strong> and <strong>Jupyter</strong> have grown to be the product of thousands of contributors and users. We are always seeking to ensure the project is welcoming, supports an increasingly diverse community, and helps solidify a foundation for it to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Let’s make it crystal clear: <strong>The project exists to serve the community and wouldn’t be possible without you</strong>.</p>
<p>So, thank <strong>YOU</strong> for your continuous support, contributions, and feedback!</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong></p>
<p>On a personal note, I would also like to thank <strong>Anaconda, Inc</strong>. I have been working here for a long time now and it was/is a great experience. I am grateful for the generous support they provided in building the next <strong>Jupyter</strong> experience, <strong>JupyterLab</strong>. And I am also grateful for the continuous support in my involvement with the <strong>Jupyter</strong> community. I really appreciate that!</p>
<h3 id="Update-(Jun)">Update (Jun)<a class="anchor-link" href="#Update-(Jun)">¶</a></h3><p>Last weekend a big part of the <strong>Jupyter</strong> team received the announced prize in the <strong>ACM</strong> 2018 banquet at San Francisco, CA.
Some pics or it did not happen!</p>

<p>A better quality one ;-)</p>

<p>Thanks again to all who contributes to the project!</p>
