<p>Quick post! I have beta packages available for you to test <strong>RISE</strong>, if you can test it that would be awesome!!</p>
<p>In case you don't know about it, with <strong>RISE</strong> you get your <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebook rendered as a Reveal.js-based slideshow, where you can <strong>execute</strong> code on the fly or show to the audience whatever you can show/do inside the notebook itself (but in a "slidy" way).</p>
<p>How you can get it?
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<p>You have several ways to get it that I described here: <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#installation">https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#installation</a></p>
<p>I don't want to repeat myself ;-) so go the the above link and check it.</p>
<p>The 4.0.0 release essentially deals with packaging and stuff to be compatible with the latest mechanisms on the <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebook to install and enable <em>nbextensions</em> (and <strong>RISE</strong> is a <em>nbextension</em>). But also fixes bugs and provide some enhancements.</p>
<p>Please report any issues with the beta here: <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/issues">https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/issues</a></p>
<p>Have fun!!</p>
<p>PS: I will write a more detailed post about <strong>RISE</strong> later. There are a lot of things to share about it!</p>
