<p>I am very proud to have this kind of conference in my country, and I would like to <strong>thanks</strong> to the organizers (and the sponsors) for all their hard work to make it happens.</p>
<p>The conference will have exciting talks, tutorials and poster presentations. You can check the <strong>schedule</strong> <a href="http://scipycon.com.ar/schedule/">here</a></p>
<p>I will be presenting a <strong>tutorial</strong> called, <strong>Python Científico: Episodio I (Scientific Python: Episode I)</strong>. You can check the details <a href="http://scipycon.com.ar/activities/">here</a>.</p>
<p>And I will be also presenting a <strong>talk</strong> called, <strong>IPython notebook: el "paper ejecutable" (IPython notebook: the "executable paper")</strong>.</p>
<p>This conference will be a <strong>boost</strong> for our growing Scientific Pythonic Community and an exciting beginning!</p>
<p>Why I am writing in English about a Spanish Conference? Because I want to <strong>spread</strong> the word about this conference as much as I can and because there are international speakers scheduled (and I <strong>would love</strong> to see more in the next conference!)</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>
<p>Damián.</p>
