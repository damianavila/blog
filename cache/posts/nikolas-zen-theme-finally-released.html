<p>Just a quick update... Some weeks ago I <a href="../posts/a-new-nikolas-theme-for-my-site-zen.html">blogged</a> about my new <strong>Nikola</strong>'s theme family called <strong>Zen</strong>. In fact, you are seeing the <code>zen-ipython</code> theme powering my blog right now.</p>
<p>I have used them for several days without any remarkable issue, so I decided to release them at the <strong>Nikola</strong>'s <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-themes">theme repository</a>.</p>
<p>There, you will see three <strong>Zen</strong> themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zen</code>, based in <em>mako</em> templates</li>
<li><code>zen-jinja</code>, the same <em>zen</em> theme but based (obviously) in <em>jinja</em> templates</li>
<li><code>zen-ipython</code>, a <em>jinja</em>-based <em>zen</em> theme suited to be used with the IPython notebooks.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>As you know, you can easily install them using the following command inside your <strong>Nikola</strong> site folder:</p>
<p><code>nikola install_theme zen</code></p>
<p>(or <code>zen-jinja</code>... or <code>zen-ipython</code>, or whatever theme available at <a href="http://themes.getnikola.com/">http://themes.getnikola.com/</a>).</p>
<p>I have developed the <strong>Zen</strong> theme family with a <em>high customization</em> concept in my mind... but this approach has a cost because you need to use a <em>proper</em> <code>conf.py</code> file to run them ok (the default one will not work, but you can find a working example looking at my blog <code>conf.py</code> <a href="https://github.com/damianavila/damian_blog/blob/master/conf.py">file</a>.</p>
<p>OK, it's all for this post.</p>
<p>Enjoy the <strong>Zen</strong> themes and, as usually, report me any problem...</p>
