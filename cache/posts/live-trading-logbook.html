<p>After some weeks of silence, he he... I come back with a short post about <em>live</em> trading in the <strong>forex</strong> market.
As you probably know [if not, you are knowing it right now ;-)], one of my interests is the <em>analysis</em>, <em>modeling</em> and <em>forecasting</em> of financial time series. To make it short, I have developed some statistical models to forecast the dynamic of selected portfolios.
Currently, I am trading equities and other more complex financial derivatives. But my models are also suitable to apply to other markets, ie. the <strong>foreign exchange</strong> market (yes... <strong>forex</strong>). So, I made a quick research on some interesting <strong>forex</strong> pairs and then I started a little account to perform some <em>live trades</em> accordingly to these models.
And now, I pretend to <em>log</em> the trades from this little account in a subset of post on my blog, a sort of public <em>live trading logbook</em>.</p>
<p>OK, we can start the logging right now! I opened two <strong>short</strong> positions some days ago:
<!-- TEASER_END --></p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Ticket</th>               
<th>Date</th>
<th>Transaction</th>
<th>Currency Pair</th>
<th>Price</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1350434307</td>
<td>2013-11-05 22:08:02</td>
<td>Sell Market</td>
<td>GBP/AUD</td>
<td>1.68983</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1350434298</td>
<td>2013-11-05 22:07:59</td>
<td>Sell Market</td>
<td>AUD/USD</td>
<td>0.94939</td>
</tr>
</table><p>And is time to close them... so closing them whereas I am writing this post (just wait me a minute, I will be back!).</p>
<p>OK, I closed both positions:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Ticket</th>               
<th>Date</th>
<th>Transaction</th>
<th>Currency Pair</th>
<th>Price</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1355893384</td>
<td>2013-11-13 01:25:10</td>
<td>Close Trade</td>
<td>GBP/AUD</td>
<td>1.70790</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1355893378</td>
<td>2013-11-13 01:25:09</td>
<td>Close Trade</td>
<td>AUD/USD</td>
<td>0.93063</td>
</tr>
</table><p>And I added some pics to illustrate these trades:</p>

<p>With these trades, we had a net increment of <strong>4.5%</strong> in the <em>balance</em>!</p>
<p>Nice beginning! Let's see how far we can go...</p>
