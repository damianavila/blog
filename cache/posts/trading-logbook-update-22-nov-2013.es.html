<p>OK, logging my trades in the <strong>forex</strong> market, as I promised in the last post.</p>
<p>FYI, I am a daily trader, so you will see me holding positions over several days.
Last week, I performed some <em>real account trades</em> accordingly to my models, opening positions at several currencies pairs. You can see the detailed information in the table below:</p>

<p>As you can see, I have yet some open positions because I am waiting to see how these positions evolve over the next week and, obviously, because my models do not signal me to close these trades... yet ;-)</p>
<p>As a plus, I have added a new column to the table containing my <em>Relative Balance</em> (because it is not probably a good idea that you know my current balance), and after this week, we have an overall net profit of <strong>8%</strong>. You have to take into account that I have set up this account to trade at a high risk profile... so <em>understand this net profit in terms of this high risk</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, I have also decided to <strong>live tweet</strong> the trades from this account, so if you follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/damian_avila">twitter</a>, you will see these trades on real time, or you can wait to the Fridays when I will post another sheet of this sort of logbook.</p>
<p>Good weekend!</p>
