<p>A long time without writing any stuff, I know...</p>
<p>But here you have me, again, writing a few lines from the top of my head.</p>
<p>And this time to let you know about some personal updates.</p>

<p>I joined <a href="https://2i2c.org/">2i2c</a> on April 2021 after experiencing successful and enriching chapters in company-like and university-like environments. <strong>2i2c</strong> is a non-for-profit organization with the <a href="https://2i2c.org/mission/">mission</a> to make research and education more impactful, accessible, and delightful by developing, operating, and supporting infrastructure for interactive computing. I started as an <strong>OSIE</strong> (Open Source Infrastructure Engineer) and eventually became an <strong>Engineering Manager</strong> for the Engineering team.</p>
<p>During all these years at <strong>2i2c</strong>, I had the opportunity to build super impactful stuff, side-by-side, with <a href="https://2i2c.org/organization/"><strong>AWESOME</strong> people</a>.
And I really appreciate and enjoyed that opportunity.
But some months ago, and after a lot of thinking, I realized I needed some real <strong>break</strong>/<strong>resting</strong> time to re-align myself, think about the future, and potentially <strong>explore</strong> new worlds.
And without a clear cut that would have been impossible, so I decided to leave <strong>2i2c</strong> by the end of August.</p>
<p>It was emotionally demanding not only because of all the <strong>great connections</strong> I have with the <strong>2i2c</strong> team members, some of them even older than the organization itself, but also because I believe in the impactfulness of (and I care about) <strong>2i2c</strong>'s mission.
But after the initial impact, a nice holiday on the beach, a lot of time with <strong>my family</strong> and a lot of time with <strong>myself</strong> (and out of the daily "voragine"), I am now feeling invigorated and excited about the idea of new challenges lying ahead.</p>
<p>This is actually the first time in years I do not have something lined up before departing from the organization I was part of.
That was a <strong>conscientious decision</strong> so I could explore different ideas, concepts, and potential new paths before choosing what the new chapter was gonna be about.</p>
<p>I am still <strong>exploring</strong> the broad space (although I do think that exploration phase is sunsetting), so if you have some interesting ideas/problems/challenges (there is a lot of new and exciting stuff being built out there!) and you believe my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-avila/">knowledge and expertise</a> can help you to push forward those ones, you can reach me at <code>damianavila AT gmail DOT com</code> (or you can also drop me a DM on <a href="https://x.com/damian_avila">X</a> or <a href="https://t.me/damian_avila">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-avila/">LinkedIn</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks for the precious time you spent reading my words!</p>

<p>PS: My current short term plan is to keep pushing on some personal projects I am actively working on (in addition to finishing the exploration phase) but I am open to start doing <strong>super interesting things</strong> if the <strong>right opportunity</strong> arises ;-)</p>
